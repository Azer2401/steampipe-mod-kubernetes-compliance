## Overview

We are adding additional checks to improve the information gathering around other Kubernetes compliance best practices. Some of these checks are derived from CIS v 1.2.0 and some are out of the scope of any predefined benchmarks for Kubernetes but we consider them very helpful. **Note** that in the future CIS benchmark will be a separate benchmark.
