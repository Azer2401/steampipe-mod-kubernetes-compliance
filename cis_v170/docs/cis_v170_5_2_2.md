## Description

Containers should always run with a read-only root filesystem. Using an immutable root filesystem and a verified boot mechanism prevents against attackers from owning the machine through permanent local changes. An immutable root filesystem can also prevent malicious binaries from writing to the host system.

## Rationale

Running containers with a read-only root filesystem provides several security benefits:

1. **Prevents Persistence**: Attackers cannot write malicious files that persist across container restarts
2. **Reduces Attack Surface**: Eliminates the ability to write to the filesystem, reducing potential attack vectors
3. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Ensures containers behave consistently and predictably
4. **Compliance**: Meets security standards and regulatory requirements

## Impact

- **Security**: Significantly reduces the risk of container breakout and persistence
- **Reliability**: Ensures consistent container behavior across deployments
- **Compliance**: Helps meet security standards and audit requirements

## Audit

Check if containers are configured with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` in their security context.

## Remediation

### Option 1: Security Context Configuration

Configure the security context in your pod specifications:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx:latest
    securityContext:
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 1000
```

### Option 2: Pod Security Standards

Use Pod Security Standards to enforce read-only filesystems:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: v1.24
```

### Option 3: Policy Engine

Use OPA Gatekeeper or Kyverno to enforce read-only filesystems:

```yaml
# Kyverno Policy
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-readonly-root-fs
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  rules:
  - name: check-readonly-root-fs
    match:
      resources:
        kinds:
        - Pod
    validate:
      message: "Containers must have readOnlyRootFilesystem set to true"
      pattern:
        spec:
          containers:
          - securityContext:
              readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

## Handling Temporary Writes

If your application requires temporary writes, use emptyDir volumes:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-with-temp-writes
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:latest
    securityContext:
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    volumeMounts:
    - name: temp-dir
      mountPath: /tmp
      readOnly: false
  volumes:
  - name: temp-dir
    emptyDir: {}
```

## Testing

Verify the configuration works correctly:

```bash
# Test if the container can write to filesystem
kubectl exec -it secure-pod -- touch /test-file
# Should fail with permission denied

# Check if temporary directory is writable
kubectl exec -it app-with-temp-writes -- touch /tmp/test-file
# Should succeed
```

## Default Value

By default, containers run with a writable root filesystem, which is not secure.
