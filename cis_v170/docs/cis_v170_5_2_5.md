## Description

Containers should not run in the host network of the node where the pod is deployed. When running on the host network, the pod can use the network namespace and network resources of the node. In this case, the pod can access loopback devices, listen to addresses, and monitor the traffic of other pods on the node.

## Rationale

Preventing host network access is important because:

1. **Network Isolation**: Maintains proper network isolation between pods
2. **Security**: Prevents pods from accessing host network resources
3. **Port Conflicts**: Avoids port conflicts with host services
4. **Traffic Monitoring**: Prevents unauthorized monitoring of other pods' traffic
5. **Compliance**: Meets security standards and regulatory requirements

## Impact

- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to host network resources
- **Isolation**: Maintains proper pod network isolation
- **Stability**: Prevents port conflicts and network issues
- **Compliance**: Helps meet security standards

## Audit

Check if pods are configured with `hostNetwork: true` in their specifications.

## Remediation

### Option 1: Remove Host Network Configuration

Ensure pods do not use host networking:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  # hostNetwork: false (default) or omit entirely
```

### Option 2: Use Services for External Access

Use Kubernetes services instead of host networking:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

### Option 3: Policy Enforcement

Use OPA Gatekeeper or Kyverno to prevent host networking:

```yaml
# Kyverno Policy
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: block-host-network
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  rules:
  - name: check-host-network
    match:
      resources:
        kinds:
        - Pod
    validate:
      message: "Pods must not use host networking"
      pattern:
        spec:
          hostNetwork: false
```

## Best Practices

### Use NodePort Services

For external access, use NodePort services:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-nodeport
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080
  type: NodePort
```

### Use LoadBalancer Services

For cloud environments, use LoadBalancer services:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-loadbalancer
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Use Ingress Controllers

For HTTP/HTTPS traffic, use ingress controllers:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: app.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

## Monitoring

Monitor for pods using host networking:

```bash
# Check for pods using host network
kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.spec.hostNetwork==true)]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints

# Check ingress resources
kubectl get ingress
```

## Default Value

By default, `hostNetwork` is `false`, which is the secure configuration.
