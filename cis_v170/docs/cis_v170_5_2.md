# 5.2 Pod Security

This section contains recommendations for pod security policies and container security configurations to ensure proper isolation and security of workloads.

## Controls

- [5.2.2 Ensure containers run with a read-only root filesystem](./cis_v170_5_2_2.md)
- [5.2.4 Ensure containers have resource limits defined](./cis_v170_5_2_4.md)
- [5.2.5 Ensure containers do not run with host network access](./cis_v170_5_2_5.md)
- [5.2.6 Ensure containers do not run with privileged access](./cis_v170_5_2_6.md)
- [5.2.7 Ensure containers do not run as root user](./cis_v170_5_2_7.md)
- [5.2.12 Ensure containers do not use hostPath volumes](./cis_v170_5_2_12.md)

## Overview

Pod security is a critical aspect of Kubernetes cluster security. This section focuses on ensuring that containers run with appropriate security configurations to prevent privilege escalation, resource exhaustion, and unauthorized access to host resources.

## Key Security Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Containers should run with minimal required privileges
2. **Resource Constraints**: Containers should have defined resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
3. **Isolation**: Containers should be isolated from host resources and other containers
4. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Containers should use read-only filesystems where possible
5. **Non-root Execution**: Containers should not run as root user

## Implementation Guidelines

### Container Security Context

Use security contexts to enforce security policies:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx:latest
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 1000
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "512Mi"
      requests:
        cpu: "250m"
        memory: "256Mi"
```

### Pod Security Standards

Consider implementing Pod Security Standards (PSS) for your namespaces:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: v1.24
```

### Network Policies

Implement network policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

## Compliance Requirements

- All containers must have resource limits defined
- Containers must not run with privileged access
- Containers must not run as root user
- Containers should use read-only root filesystems
- Containers must not use hostPath volumes
- Containers must not use host networking

## Monitoring and Enforcement

1. **Admission Controllers**: Use Pod Security Standards admission controllers
2. **Policy Engines**: Implement OPA Gatekeeper or Kyverno for policy enforcement
3. **Monitoring**: Use tools like Falco for runtime security monitoring
4. **Compliance Scanning**: Regular compliance checks using this benchmark
