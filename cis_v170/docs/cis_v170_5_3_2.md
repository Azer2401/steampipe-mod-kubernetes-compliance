## Description

Use CloudekaGuard policies to isolate traffic in your cluster network.

Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. CloudekaGuard is a custom resource that provides advanced network policy management capabilities using Cilium and KubeOVN.

CloudekaGuard policies are namespace scoped. When a CloudekaGuard policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not explicitly allowed by the policy is denied. However, if there are no CloudekaGuard policies in a namespace, all traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace.

CloudekaGuard provides enhanced network policy management compared to standard Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resources, with better integration with Cilium and KubeOVN networking solutions.

## Remediation

Create `CloudekaGuard` custom resources to define network policies. CloudekaGuard provides advanced features and integrates with Cilium and KubeOVN for enhanced network policy management.

### Example CloudekaGuard to deny all ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenants.cloudeka.ai/v1alpha2
kind: CloudekaGuard
metadata:
  name: deny-all-ingress
  namespace: your-namespace
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      namespace: your-namespace
  ingress:
  - {}  # Empty object in array denies all ingress traffic
```

### Example CloudekaGuard to deny all egress:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenants.cloudeka.ai/v1alpha2
kind: CloudekaGuard
metadata:
  name: deny-all-egress
  namespace: your-namespace
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      namespace: your-namespace
  egress:
  - {}  # Empty object in array denies all egress traffic
```

### Example CloudekaGuard to allow specific ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenants.cloudeka.ai/v1alpha2
kind: CloudekaGuard
metadata:
  name: allow-specific-ingress
  namespace: your-namespace
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  ingress:
  - fromEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        app: client-app
    toPorts:
    - ports:
      - port: "8080"
        protocol: TCP
```

**Important:** 
- `ingress: - {}` (array with empty object) = **DENY all ingress traffic**
- `ingress: []` (empty array) or missing ingress field = **ALLOW all ingress traffic**
- Same logic applies to `egress` rules

**Default Value:** By default, CloudekaGuard policies are not created.
